1.  Stdint.h is a C header file including definitions of fixed-width integers
2.  These types will ensure that the integer widths (bits) are the same across all platforms.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  First two bytes of bitmap file must be ASCII "BM", which is hex 0x424d.
5.  bfSize is the size of the entire bitmap file, including the headers, while biSize is just the size of the image.
6.  Negative biHeight means the bitmap image is described from the top down, beginning at the upper left.
7.  biBitCount specifies the bits-per-pixel (color depth).
8.  Line 24 would return NULL if the given file didn't exist or could not be opened. Line 32, because it is writing, will return
    NULL if the given filename contains an invalid character, or if the called lacks appropriate permission to write to the disk.
9.  The third argument is the number of blocks we want to read in. Since we are working with each block, we only want to read in
    one at a time.
10.  3.
11. fseek allows you to set the offset from the file pointer (i.e. select a location in the file stream).
12. SEEK_CUR is a from_where option in fseek that while move the curser relative to the current curser position.
